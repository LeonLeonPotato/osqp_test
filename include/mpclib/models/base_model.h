 * 
 * @details
 * This structure is used to define constraints on the state and action variables
 * in the model. Each constraint has a lower and upper bound, as well as an index
 * that indicates which variable it applies to. The index is used to map the constraint
 * to the corresponding variable in the state or action vector.
 * 
 * The constraints are used in the optimization problem to ensure that the solution
 * respects the physical limits of the system being modeled. For example, a constraint
 * on the velocity of a robot would ensure that the robot does not exceed its maximum speed.

 * @brief Abstract base class for dynamic models used in model predictive control (MPC).
 *
 * @details
 * This class defines the common interface for all dynamic models used in the MPC library.
 * Derived classes must define the dimensionality of the state and action vectors,
 * as well as the dynamics functions for simulation and automatic differentiation.
 *
 * The model also supports various types of constraints:
 * - **State constraints**: Variable-wise lower and upper bounds on the state vector.
 * - **Action constraints**: Variable-wise lower and upper bounds on the action vector.
 * - **General constraints**: Arbitrary linear constraints on the state and/or action vectors.
